# Waiting Room Routing Fix

## Issue Description
The creator/host user was being routed directly to the chat room instead of the waiting room after creating a chat. This bypassed the waiting room flow where both participants need to complete their pre-chat questionnaire before the conversation can begin.

## Root Cause
The chat creation API (`/api/chats/create`) was returning `redirectUrl: '/chat/${chatId}'` which sent users directly to the chat room, bypassing the waiting room system entirely.

## Flow Problems
**Before Fix:**
1. User creates chat → **Direct to Chat Room** (WRONG)
2. Chat room tries to check if both users are ready
3. If not ready, redirects to waiting room (reactive fix)

**After Fix:**
1. User creates chat → **Waiting Room** → Chat Room (when both ready)
2. Proper flow ensures both participants complete questionnaire
3. Chat initiates only when both are ready

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/api/chats/create/route.ts`
```diff
- redirectUrl: `/chat/${chat.id}`,
+ redirectUrl: `/waiting-room/${chat.id}`,
```

### 2. `/components/chat-setup-modal.tsx` (2 locations)
```diff
- router.push(`/chat/${chatId}`);
+ router.push(`/waiting-room/${chatId}`);
```

## What This Fixes

1. **Creator Flow**: Chat creators now go to waiting room first
2. **Invite Flow**: Users with invite links go to waiting room first  
3. **Consistent Flow**: All users follow the same path: Waiting Room → Chat Room
4. **Proper Questionnaire Completion**: Both participants must complete pre-chat forms

## What Remains Unchanged

1. **Resume Latest Chat**: Still goes directly to chat (correct behavior for existing chats)
2. **Chat Page Logic**: Still redirects to waiting room if not initiated (backup safety)
3. **Direct Chat Links**: Still work but redirect through waiting room if needed

## Testing
- Build passes successfully
- All TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Routing logic preserved for existing functionality

## Benefits
1. **Consistent User Experience**: All users follow same flow
2. **Proper Preparation**: Ensures both participants complete questionnaires
3. **Better AI Mediation**: AI gets context from both participants before starting
4. **Cleaner Logic**: Single entry point through waiting room
