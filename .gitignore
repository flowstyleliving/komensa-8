# Compiled TypeScript files (if not part of .next/ or similar)
# Generally, don't ignore .js files if you're using TypeScript,
# as Next.js handles compilation to .next/.
# However, if you have other custom compilation outputs:
# *.js
# *.d.ts
# *.js.map

# TypeScript build info
*.tsbuildinfo

# Docker (if applicable)
.dockerignore # This file itself should not be ignored
# .env.docker # If you have a separate Docker-specific .env file

# Next-Auth Specific (if you have debug files)
# Typically not needed, but if debugging generates files, add them.
